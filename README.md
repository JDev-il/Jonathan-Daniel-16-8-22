# Shopping Tracking List


### App Concept & Intentions
The aim of this app was creating an End-to-End shopping list tracker which will allow users to track items they've already bought or they intend to buy and/or even cancel over some popular worldwide online shops.

Delivering this solution to the public can be useful for people who do most of their shoppings online. Furthermore, in the near future end-users will also enjoy full compatibility for their favorite items in online shop apps with fully-integrated support and much better shopping experience.


### App Design & Architecture
This app was designed using the Angular framework(v14.1.1) which offers great front-end architecture design solution with high scalability performance and a massive 3rd-party libraries collection.
